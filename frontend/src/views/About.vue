      This project is a web application with a primary focus on trip planning.
      It includes several key features such as authentication and authorization
      for user management. Users can perform CRUD operations to modify the
      database, including adding new trips, cities, travel points, attractions,
      activities, and specifying start and end dates. The application also
      allows users to manage all data related to their stay, such as hotel
      bookings, taxi or car rentals, and details regarding arrival and departure
      dates. Integration with Google Maps enables users to add pins to their
      trip itinerary.

      Additionally, the application offers budget tracking functionalities,
      allowing users to monitor their expenses for accommodation,
      transportation, food, and activities. Users can also add other
      participants to their trips and receive notifications with reminders. A
      travel journal feature enables users to keep personal notes and upload
      photos during their trips. Furthermore, the application supports user
      reviews and ratings for the added places. Analytics tools provide insights
      such as average expenses and the most visited destinations.
